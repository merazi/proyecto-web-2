		<h1>History of the NASA</h1>
		<p>
		    The National Aeronautics and Space Administration
		    (NASA /ˈnæsə/) is an independent agency of the
		    U.S. federal government responsible for the civil
		    space program, aeronautics research, and space
		    research. Established in 1958, it succeeded the
		    National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA)
		    to give the U.S. space development effort a
		    distinctly civilian orientation, emphasizing
		    peaceful applications in space science.  It has
		    since led most American space exploration,
		    including Project Mercury, Project Gemini, the
		    1968–1972 Apollo Moon landing missions, the Skylab
		    space station, and the Space Shuttle. It currently
		    supports the International Space Station and
		    oversees the development of the Orion spacecraft
		    and the Space Launch System for the crewed lunar
		    Artemis program, the Commercial Crew spacecraft,
		    and the planned Lunar Gateway space station.</p>
		<p>
		    NASA's science is focused on better understanding
		    Earth through the Earth Observing System;
		    advancing heliophysics through the efforts of the
		    Science Mission Directorate's Heliophysics
		    Research Program; exploring bodies throughout the
		    Solar System with advanced robotic spacecraft such
		    as New Horizons and planetary rovers such as
		    Perseverance; and researching astrophysics topics,
		    such as the Big Bang, through the James Webb Space
		    Telescope, the Great Observatories and associated
		    programs. The Launch Services Program oversees
		    launch operations and countdown management for its
		    uncrewed launches.
